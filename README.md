This was just for me and a friend.

It's designed to easily tell if your friends are online and available to hang out.



The home directory for the ftp user **must** have two folders: `Users` and `GamerStatus`. Within the `GamerStatus` Folder there must be one folder, `Online`. Ideally I'd write the code to set that up for you but,
