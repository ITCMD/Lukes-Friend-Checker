It's designed to easily tell if your friends are online and available to hang out.

All you need is the main file (found in the releases folder) and it will download the rest for you.

### If you're setting up with your own FTP server

The home directory for the ftp user **must** have two folders: `Users` and `GamerStatus`. Within the `GamerStatus` Folder there must be one folder, `Online`. Ideally I'd write the code to set that up for you but,

It also stores FTP server logins in plain text, so if you do use this, use it with an isolated user and bandwidth limits. Ideally I'd write it in another language or at least use PowerShell to encrypt the logins for you but, once again,
